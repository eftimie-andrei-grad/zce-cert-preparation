About this Repository
=====================

This repository aims to be a community wiki (a la git pull requests) of useful PHP Standard Template Library (SPL) examples. The php.net website lacks user submitted examples in the SPL department, so Queen City PHP (http://qcphp.org) is taking the initiative to provide examples and spread the word.

All of the base level PHP files are working examples of their SPL iterator counterparts. Documentation will be added to the readme in the future.

Regarding the Examples
-------------------------

Each example can be run from the command line, i.e.:

````
php -f caching-iterator.php
````

Which will produce example output in your console/terminal.
